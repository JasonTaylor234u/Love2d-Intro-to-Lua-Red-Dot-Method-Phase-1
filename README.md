# Love2d-Intro-to-Lua-Red-Dot-Method-Phase-1
This repository is a project I am working on that will advance into a full custom game within the next 30 days. 
To play the game, click on the red dot. The dot will move within the the screen. Everytime you click on the red dot, your score will increase
New* A timer will be added (You will have a certain amount of time to perform a certain amount of clicks)
